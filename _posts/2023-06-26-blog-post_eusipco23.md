### Tutorial on "Estimation, Filtering, and Decoding via Deep Learning" at EUSIPCO 2023!

Join us for an in-depth tutorial on estimation, filtering, and decoding with domain-informed deep learning techniques at the upcoming EUSIPCO 2023 in Helsinki!

🎓 Tutorial Topic: Estimation, Filtering, and Decoding via Deep Learning
🗓 Date: September 4, 2023
🌍 Conference: EUSIPCO 2023
🔗 Registration Link: [https://eurasip.org/eusipco-registration/](https://eurasip.org/eusipco-registration/)

🔎 Explore the powerful synergy between classical signal processing and modern deep learning, and discover how the judicious combination of these fields is revolutionizing the algorithm design process, giving rise to a new emerging field: **Machine-Learning-Enhanced Signal Processing**. From localization, denoising, and interference mitigation to decoding, we'll share some of our key insights and rule-of-thumbs for applying deep learning models for enhanced performance and accuracy.

👨‍🏫 I will give this tutorial together with my MIT colleagues [Amir Weiss](https://www.weissamir.com/) and [Gary Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/garyleecf/).

This tutorial will provide you with:
✅ A clear methodology for applying deep learning techniques in contemporary signal processing
✅ Concrete engineering rule-of-thumbs for developing such solutions for your own projects
✅ Hands-on introductory coding session on the starter code of the [RF Challenge](https://rfchallenge.mit.edu/)
✅ Networking opportunities with like-minded professionals

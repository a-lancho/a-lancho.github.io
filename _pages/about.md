# About
I received my B.E., M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Spain, in 2013, 2014 and 2019, respectively. During the fall of 2017, I was a visiting researcher at Chalmers University of Technology. Since October, 2019, I work at Chalmers University of Technology as a postdoctoral researcher. 

Next fall, I will start my recently awarded Marie-Sklodowska Curie global fellowship. The outgoing phase will be at the MIT under the supervision of Prof. Yury Polyanskiy, and the return phase will be at UC3M, Spain, under the supervision of Prof. Tobias Koch.  

I was an FPU fellow (Spanish Ministerio de Educaci√≥n Cultura y Deporte) during my Ph.D. studies. I was among the six finalists for the IEEE Jack Keil Wolf ISIT Student Paper Award at the 2017 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory, Aachen, Germany, 2017.




  

# Research interests
My research interests are in the areas of information theory and wireless communications. Specifically,

- Finite blocklength information theory with applications to
  - Short-packet communications
  - Ultra-reliable low-latency communications
  - Massive MIMO
  - Massive random access

See my [CV](/files/cv_ALS.pdf) for further information.
